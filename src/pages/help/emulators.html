<h3>Why so many MAME versions?</h3>

<p>
    MAME is an old project, dating back to the end of the 90's. As with many popular open source
    emulators, over the years there have been many competitors, forks and splits.<br>
    These forks include the various Libretro versions, MAME4ALL, and AdvanceMAME. Each of these
    have patched the original fork to improve some buggy or non-working games.
</p>

<p>
    The "lr-" versions are made to be used with Libretro, the library used by most emulators in Retropie, allowing
    all emulators to have a common control configuration, shaders, menu, etc.<br>
    <a href="https://github.com/squidrpi/mame4all-pi" class="blank">MAME4ALL</a> is a fork of an old version (2000)
    that aims to run games as fast as possible, even on weaker hardware.<br>
    <a href="https://www.advancemame.it" class="blank">AdvanceMAME</a> is a fork of a not-quite-as-old MAME version
    (2005 or 2006), optimized to run inside actual arcade cabinets, notably with CRT screens.
</p>

<h3>Why so many Libretro versions?</h3>

<p>
    MAME has a stated goal of accuracy over anything else, to reference exactly how the hardware works.
    This kind of precise emulation comes at a cost: it requires a very powerful computer to run at full speed.<br>
    Older version of MAME were less precise in their emulation, and so, are faster. However, they (obviously)
    <a href="http://mamedev.org/history.html" class="blank">run fewer games</a>. So, choosing
    a Libretro MAME version is always a tradeoff between speed, accuracy and compatibility.
</p>

<h3>What about Final Burn Alpha (FBA)?</h3>

<p>
    FBA has started life as an emulator of After Burner only (hence the name).
    <a href="https://www.fbalpha.com/history/" class="blank">Over time</a>, games and systems have been added,
    and it now emulates a very large number of games, although still smaller than MAME.<br>
    The goal of FBA is not accuracy, and as a result, games generally run much faster on recent FBA versions
    than on recent MAME versions.
</p>

<h3>So, which one should I choose?</h3>

<p>
    Unfortunately, there is no easy answer, and it varies from game to game, and on your personal preferences.<br>
    The generally agreed-upon consensus on a Raspberry seems to be this one:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you have a Pi 1 or Pi Zero, prefer MAME4ALL because it's much faster</li>
    <li>Otherwise, by default, use FBA because it's fast, and emulates many games quite well</li>
    <li>For all the games that FBA do not emulate, use MAME 2003 because it's faster</li>
    <li>MAME 2010 is the preferred emulator for games that do not work in either FBA or MAME 2003, because it's
        still mostly fast enough, and have less bugs</li>
    <li>Vector games like Asteroids are generally better to run on AdvanceMAME, because it makes them prettier</li>
    <li>Other MAME versions are generally too old (2000) or too slow (2014, 2016), but again, it's a matter of
        personal preference.</li>
</ul>
