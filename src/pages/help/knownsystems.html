<h2>Known systems</h2>

<p>
    Each system has strict requirements to load overlays, and they're all different (otherwise where's the fun?).
    This utility can only install overlays on know systems, with a fixed and predictable folder structure,
    because it has to define absolute paths (and replaces them on the fly while copying the overlays).
</p>

<p>
    If you want to install on another system (like on your PC):
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Create a config folder somewhere, let's say <code>C:\Arcade\config</code></li>
    <li>Run the utility, and select <strong>Recalbox</strong>.</li>
    <li>Open the Install Overlays menu. It should now display text fields for rom and config.</li>
    <li>Select the folder where your roms are located, and the folder you created, then run "Download and install".</li>
    <li>
        Edit the paths in the downloaded cfg files:
        <ul>
            <li>Move the files located in <code>overlays/fba_libretro/arcade-xxxx/</code> where you want
                (including the "common" folder).</li>
            <li>Move the <code>overlays/roms/romname.zip.cfg</code> files where they need to be; it depends
                on the system: next to the roms? In a special folder? Check the doc, ask around.</li>
            <li>In the <code>romname.zip.cfg</code> file, edit the paths to point to the config files</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
