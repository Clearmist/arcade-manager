<h2>Which romsets are supported?</h2>

<p>
    Only merged and non-merged romsets are supported.<br>
    If you use this tool to copy a split set, the clones won't work because the parents won't be copied.<br>
    Support for split set is not planned, because it's much more complicated than what I want to do.
