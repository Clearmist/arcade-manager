<p>
    DAT (XML) files, used by tools like MAME and CLR MAME Pro, are a great tool to check, rebuild and
    convert romsets.<br>
    However, they lack many useful informations: screen resolution, arcade system (Bally/Midway, CPS X,
    Sega System X...), emulation status, game type, etc.<br>
    They are also generally pretty large, and cannot easily be toyed with if you don't use specialized
    software.<br>

<p>
    Using a CSV file (wether exported from <a href="http://adb.arcadeitalia.net/lista_mame.php?lang=en" class="blank">ArcadeItalia</a>
    or completely custom-made) allows anyone with Excel (or any text editor) to filter the lists and
    create their own custom collection.

    You can convert a DAT file to a CSV file using this tool, if you already have a DAT file that
    you like to use.
