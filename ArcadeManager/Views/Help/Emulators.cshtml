<h3>Why so many MAME versions?</h3>

<p>
    MAME is an old project, dating back to the end of the 90's. As with many popular open source
    emulators, over the years there have been many competitors, forks and splits.
    Among others, these forks include MAME4ALL, AdvanceMAME, and the Libretro ports. Each of these
    have specific improvements over the base MAME.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        The "lr-" versions have been modified to use Libretro, a library unifying emulators, used in RetroArch,
        Retropie, Recalbox, and others.
    </li>
    <li>
        MAME4ALL> is a fork of an old version (2000) that aims to run games as fast as possible, even on weaker hardware.
    </li>
    <li>
        AdvanceMAME is a fork of another old version (2006), optimized to be displayed on CRT screens.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Why so many lr-MAME versions?</h3>

<p>
    MAME has a stated goal of accuracy over anything else, to reference exactly how the hardware works.
    This kind of precise emulation comes at a cost: it requires a quite powerful computer to run at full speed.
    Older version of MAME were less precise in their emulation, and so, are faster. However, they (obviously)
    run fewer games and have more bugs. So, choosing a Libretro MAME version is always a tradeoff between speed,
    accuracy and compatibility.
</p>
<p>
    Basically, the latest MAME version is quite stable and runs pretty well on a PC, but some games (especially
    since the mid-90's) are slow on weaker hardware like a Raspberry Pi ; whereas MAME2003+ is overall faster, but
    has quite a lot of bugs : for instance, most Toaplan games don't have sound.
</p>

<h3>What about Final Burn Alpha (FBA) and Final Burn Neo (FBNeo)?</h3>

<p>
    FBA has started life as an emulator of After Burner only (hence the name).
    <a href="https://www.fbalpha.com/history/" class="blank">Over time</a>, games and systems have been added,
    and it now emulates a very large number of games, although still smaller than MAME.<br>
    After some problem with the FBA "owner", most of the dev team split to create their own fork: Final Burn Neo.
    Alpha is basically dead at this point.
</p>
<p>
    The goal of FBNeo is not accuracy, and as a result, games generally run much faster on recent FBNeo
    versions than on recent MAME versions ; it also has more user features than MAME, and is easier to use.
    However, FBNeo doesn't emulate a single 3D system, so you won't be able to play Tekken or Ridge Racer with it.
</p>

<h3>So, which one should I choose?</h3>

<p>
    Unfortunately, there is no easy answer, and it varies from game to game, and on your personal preferences.<br>
    The generally agreed-upon consensus is this one:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>By default, use FBNeo because it's fast, and emulates most games quite well</li>
    <li>For all the games that FBNeo do not emulate, use MAME</li>
</ul>

<p>
    I personnaly do not recommend to use MAME2003+ by default, even on Raspberry Pi, except on some specific games
    that are too slow using FBNeo.
</p>

<p>
    If you have a Pi 1 or Pi Zero, prefer MAME4ALL because it's much faster.
