WIZARD_EMULATOR_FBNEO_DESC=Has the best balance between performance and accuracy, but the games list is a bit more limited (1900+, no 3D game).<br /><strong>Prefer this if you play on Raspberry Pi 4</strong>.
WIZARD_EMULATOR_MAME_NAME=MAME - latest version (0.249)
WIZARD_EMULATOR_MAME_DESC=Has the largest games list (3500+ games) and highest emulation accuracy, but also requires the most power, even for older games.<br /><strong>Prefer this if you play on PC</strong>.

WIZARD_EMULATOR_MAME2003_DESC=Has the best performance, but has quite a lot of bugs, non-working games, and other problems.<br /><strong>Prefer this if you play on Raspberry Pi 3</strong>.

WIZARD_LIST_TITLE=Automatic installation: games lists
WIZARD_LIST_INTRO=<p>Please choose the games selection(s) you want.</p><p>All the games have been tested and work with a retro pad (SNES-like) or an arcade stick. Sometimes gameplay is possible but not ideal without a dedicated control (ex: racing games).</p><p>Note that the various "tops" have duplicates: selecting the top200 and the top50 will only result in 200 games, since the top50 is a sub-selection of the top200.<br />Obviously the "tops" are highly subjective, and mainly destined to people who don't know much about arcade games. This tool also easily lets you <a href="/Csv">define your own lists</a>.</p>
WIZARD_LIST_TOP200=<strong>Top 200</strong>: a balanced selection of all the great games, and a few hidden gems : a great trip down memory lane, finding new things along the ride.

WIZARD_LIST_TOP80S=<strong>Top of the 80's</strong>: from Asteroids to Final Fight, the {0} best old-school games.
WIZARD_LIST_TOP90S=<strong>Top of the 90's and 00's</strong>: from Smash TV to Deathsmiles, the {0} best modern games.
WIZARD_LIST_ICONS=<strong>Icons</strong>: {0} groundbreaking, revolutionary, unique, or just very popular games. May not be very good by today's standards, or compared to their follow-ups.<br /><strong>Warning:</strong> some games in this list will not work well with a simple retro pad or arcade stick, and you might need a spinner, double stick, racing wheel, etc. You can sometimes get good results by changing the control settings in the options.
WIZARD_LIST_MULTIPLAYER=<strong>Multiplayer</strong>: {0} great games to play with two players or more, in coop or versus.
WIZARD_LIST_NEOGEO=<strong>NeoGeo</strong>: the {0} best games on NeoGeo, the most popular and enduring arcade system.
